# Required Params {#required-params}
Any POST & PUT requests should have `Content-Type` header with `application/json` value.
Otherwise, you will get an HTTP error 500 (`UnknownError`).

# Authorization & Authentication {#auth}
Most API methods require specifying an API token within `Authorization` header.
Example:
```
curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Token' https://api.boticord.top/v3/bots/:id/stats --data-raw '{"servers":100}'
```
Where `Token` is your key.

## Getting an API key {#key}
Follow these steps to get an API key:
1. Go to [your profile](https://boticord.top/me).
2. Click on `settings` icon.
3. Click on `API` tab.
4. Click on `Generate` button at the bottom of the page.
5. Copy your key.
**This token is valid only for bots and servers owned by the account that generated it**

# Rate Limits {#rate-limit}
:::caution Warning
If you exceed the request limit, you will be temporarily blocked. In case of abuse, you can get a permanent lock to the resource.
:::
Global rate limit is 25 requests per 10 seconds. If you exceed this limit, you will receive HTTP error 429.

# Responses {#response}

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="200" label="Successful response">
        <CodeBlock language='json' showLineNumbers>{`{

    // some data....
  }

        </CodeBlock>

    <TabItem value="50" label="Error 4xx/5xx">
        In case of any non-fatal error, the server will send the following data:
        <CodeBlock language='json' showLineNumbers>{`{
  "ok": false,
  "result": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": 3,
      "message": "CriticalError"
    }
  ]
}
              `}
        </CodeBlock>
        Property <code>code</code> this is the error ID from <a href={'#errors'}>this table</a>. With these numbers
        it is easy to program a specific response to an error (for example, a translation into human language).
        These numbers will never change, but new ones may be added.
        Property <code>message</code> this is a brief description of the error in English for quick debagging of the error.
